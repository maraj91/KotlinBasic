# What is Kotlin

Kotlin is expressive, concise, extensible, powerful, and a joy to read and write. It has wonderful safety features in terms 
of nullability and immutability,which aligns with our investments to make Android apps healthy and performant by default.
If you're interested in using Kotlin, it's easy to get started because it works side by side with Java and C++ on Android.
So you can keep your existing code, continue to use the various Android libraries, and incrementally add Kotlin code to 
your project. Unlike almost any other language, Kotlin is a drop-in replacement you can use bi-directionallyâ€”you can call
into the Java language from Kotlin, and you can call into Kotlin from the Java language.
